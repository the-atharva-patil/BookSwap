Whether you're a student, book lover, or collector, you can find a wide variety of books to meet your needs.Are you a college going student and are upset with the increasing number of used books after each new semester, or you are a regular book reader who after reading the books, keep the old books on the bookshelves or in a cupboard and forget them? If yes, then Clankart is just made for you!

        Bookswap is India's leading platform where you can sell used books online. At Bookswap, we help people to sell their used books to another book lover just like them at interesting prices.
        
        Selling and buying books on Clankart is a win-win situation for both the buyer and the seller. How? Let's see. As a seller, you can earn some good amount of money by selling your old books (which you don't even need) to another person at good prices. And being a buyer, you can save some money by buying the second hand books directly from the book owner.
